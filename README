koha-git-upgrade.sh
-------------------

This script is designed to be run as a cron job, it requires that you
have an existing git repository and that you have done an install from
it.

It will fetch and rebase, then do an install, then check to see if a
database upgrade is needed. 

I'm about to extend it to email if the install fails or an upgrade is
needed
